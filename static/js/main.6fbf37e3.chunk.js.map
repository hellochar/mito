You can only walk on Tissue (and Transport). You start at the center of the map, with soil\r\n            below and air above.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h3>Soil and Underground</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Underground, Soil holds water, rocks block your way, and occasionally Fountains (at the very bottom) are a\r\n            permanent source of water. Soil is split up into Sand, Silt, and Clay. Water flows through sand easily, silt\r\n            normally, and clay slowly. Fountains emit one water per 3 seconds.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h3>Air and Aboveground</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Aboveground, Air provides both sunlight and co2. Sunlight determines the ratio of waters-per-sugar at which\r\n            reactions happen and are affected by shadows. Co2 determines the speed of reaction and gets better as you\r\n            build higher up. Orange is low co2, blue is high co2. Gravity will pull down on your structures, so make\r\n            sure they're structurally sound. Your structures cast shadows on the leaves below in relation to the sun,\r\n            which gently sways left to right.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h3>Water</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Water is one of the main two resources. Water slowly diffuses from high to low densities, and is pulled down\r\n            by gravity. Obtain water in the ground through Roots. Leaves require water to photosynthesize. You require\r\n            water to build.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h3>Sugar</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Sugar is the other main resource. Sugar does not diffuse. Leaves convert water into sugar. Obtain sugar by\r\n            putting water next to leaves. Cells require sugar to survive. You require sugar to build.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h3>Building</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Build Tissue, Leaves, Roots, and The Fruit by toggling \"build mode\" on and walking into Air or Soil. Build\r\n            Transport over existing tissue by walking around. Building costs 1 sugar and 1 water. You can build Tissue\r\n            over Leaves and Roots - be careful! When you build above ground, Cells will Droop if they're not properly\r\n            supported underneath them.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h3>Cells</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            All cells require energy upkeep and will automatically eat sugar on their tile, or get energy from their\r\n            neighbors.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h3>Tissue</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Tissue connects your plant together, you may only walk on Tissue. Each Tissue carries up to{\" \"}\r\n            {TISSUE_INVENTORY_CAPACITY} resources.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h3>Roots</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Roots are the only way to get water. Each turn Roots transport one water per neighboring soil into the\r\n            Tissue in the opposite direction (so the Tissue North of the root get water in the South tile). This is\r\n            called a Pairing.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h3>Leaves</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            When exposed to Air, Leaves convert water to sugar. Leaves also use Pairings between opposite direction\r\n            Air/Tissue with water. In perfect co2 and Water availability, Leaves produce 1 sugar every{\" \"}\r\n            {LEAF_REACTION_TIME.toFixed(2)} seconds per pair. Leaf efficiency is heavily influenced by co2 and sunlight\r\n            of its neighboring Air. If your leaf is in too much shadow, it will not be able to photosynthesize. Leaves\r\n            higher up produce sugar faster.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h3>Transport</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Transports move 1 water from its own Tile in the direction it was laid per turn, as well as moving you.\r\n            Transport hungers at double speed.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h3>The Fruit</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            You can only build one Fruit, and it is the goal of the game to fill it up with resources. Fruit has up to\r\n            1000 sugar storage and aggressively pulls in every available sugar in its surrounding vicinity.\r\n          </p>\r\n          {this.renderCredit()}\r\n
